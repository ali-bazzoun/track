# track

is a project aimed at achieving highly precise positioning by fusing data from multiple sensors, including cameras, IMUs, and potentially other sensors in the future. The ultimate goal is to provide robust and accurate 6 Degrees of Freedom (6DoF) pose estimation for robotics navigation.

At this early stage, the project focuses on visual-inertial odometry (VIO) as a foundational step toward full sensor fusion.

## Current Status

- Early development phase.
- Exploring and comparing state-of-the-art VIO algorithms (e.g., MSCKF, OKVIS, VINS-Mono, OpenVINS).
- Future work will expand to include additional sensors for enhanced precision.
